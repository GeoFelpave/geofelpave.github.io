Hola! I'm Luis Felipe and I am originally from Colombia, but I have been settled in the UK for almost 15 years now. Currently I'm a PhD researcher with [The EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Geospatial Systems](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/geospatial-systems/) at Newcastle University. My background is in the use, development, deployment and management of desktop and web-based geographic information systems (GIS) and business intelligence (BI) systems. Before joining the CDT I worked as a GIS researcher and project coordinator. I worked for and in partnership with NGOs, in both corporate and governmental organisations. I have an ambitious plan to work in the use of GeoAI and hyperresolution hydrological modelling to enable a greater understand of the impacts of climate change in Water Risks and Food Security in the Global South. This is with the desire to produce actionable knowledge for the benefit of society as a whole.

PhD Research
======
For many areas across the globe physically-based hydrological models have a fundamental role helping devise a comprehensive and robust plan for future climate change adaption and preparedness, informing water management and flood initiatives, as well as enhancing knowledge of local and regional hydrological processes. Whilst the use of physically-based hydrological models have been restricted by the nature of the process i.e. large data volumes and greater computational resources required, recent advances on satellite derived analysis ready data (ARD) availability and computational environments (online and local deployments) have served as catalyst to a wider use of these models.

In this context, my research will be at the junction of three areas:  hydrological physical modelling, satellite Earth observation data and cloud computing technology.  During the past two decades the development of hydrological predictions at spatial resolution on the order of 1km or less has been recognised as a grand challenge in hydrology.  Now that the advances in satellite and sensor technology coupled with the development of cloud computing have enable the advancement of hydrology as a data-intensive science, there is a considerable impetus and interest in future research and approaches in the use of these emerging technologies to develop new insights that contribute to fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences. My research will focus in the use of an open and freely available specialised software infrastructuretechnology  for  effective  and  efficient  EO  data  retrieval  namely,  The  Open  Data  Cube,  contributing to the development of the physically-based, spatially-distributed hydrological model SHETRAN in the context of water security as part of the Water Security & Development Hub project (https://www.watersecurityhub.org).

My background
======
Before joining the CDT I worked as a GIS researcher and project coordinator. I worked for and in partnership with NGOs, in both corporate and governmental organisations. This included planning and delivering GIS solutions for research and engagement purposes in international projects, focused on the sustainability of natural ecosystems and citizen science. Some of the projects that I have worked on include:  

- The development of a global web-based catchment hydrological information platform ([CatchX](https://ewgis.org/catchx-global/)) providing access to standard water balance information at a river catchment level, without the need for complex GIS or hydrological modelling skills. This project was funded by the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) as it was a partnership between University of Leeds, University of Rhodes â€“ South Africa, and Earthwatch Institute
- The development of [The Bath Spa Observer](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/projects/bath-spa-observer/), a digital mapping platform to facilitate student learning by using state of the art technology for data capture and use in the classroom.

Alongside my previous work and now studies, I volunteer for [MapAction](https://mapaction.org), which provides emergency mapping in humanitarian disasters, as well as training and capacity building for disaster management.
